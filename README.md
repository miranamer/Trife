<h1>What is Trife?</h1>
<p>Trife is a unique journalling application that allows users to record their days as series of decision trees. Each tree
is used to represent a particular day and is composed of different nodes. The purpose of this app is to allow you to detect patterns
in the choices you make on a daily basis and how they affect you. It also provides you with the ability to visualise how you have spent your time
and analyze how the choices you have made have led you to this very moment and what could be improved in the future.</p>

<h2>Nodes</h2>
<p>Trife contains 4 default node types - Choice Node, Good Result Node, Mid Result Node and Bad Result Node.
The general idea behind these node types is that the user can add different choice nodes representing the choices they were presented with today
and for the choices they decided to follow through with, they can add result nodes detailing how the decision they made affected them.</p>
